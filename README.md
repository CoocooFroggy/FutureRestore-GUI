```
/Users/CoocooFroggy/Downloads/futurerestore -d -t /Users/CoocooFroggy/Downloads/353561670934855681_iPhone69\,4_d200ap_18.2-31D37_27325c8258be46e69d9ee57fa9a8fbc28b873df434e5e702a8b27999551138ae.shsh2 --use-pwndfu --set-nonce=0x1111111111111111 --custom-latest 15.3.1 --latest-sep --latest-baseband /Users/CoocooFroggy/Downloads/iPhone69\,4\,iPhone20\,0_18.2_31D37_Restore.ipsw
```
- Only select BuildManifest once for both SEP and BB.
- Ensures you don't select incorrect files: The program will ensure you have a working FutureRestore build. You can only select .iPSW files for target firmware, .BBFW files for baseband, etc.
- **Download FutureRestore** will automatically fetch the latest FutureRestore for your operating system, extract it, and select it.
- **Exit Recovery** button to run `futurerestore --exit-recovery`
- **Stop FutureRestore** to kill the FutureRestore process. Button dynamically changes to "Stop FutureRestore (Unsafe)" while the process is running. Pop-up to confirm killing the process if it's currently running.
- Automatically launch with **Dark or Light mode theme**.
- **Error parsing** such as iBEC, APTicket â€“ APNonce mismatch, unable to place device in recovery mode. Will show a pop-up with some help and a link on where to get help. 
![Error Parsing Example](.github/AP%20Nonce%20Error.png?raw=true "FutureRestore GUI AP Nonce Error")
- **Automatically retry** FutureRestore only once if error received is "unable to place device in recovery mode."
- Inline **GUI progress bar** for downloading SEP, BB, Sending Filesystem, etc.
- Automatically **saves all logs** to `/[Home]/FutureRestoreGUI/logs`. Never worry about accidentally closing terminal, forgetting to paste your terminal to pastebin, etc.

- Log **smart autoscroll** when scrolled to the bottom.
- Optionally share logs automatically to help improve FutureRestore
- If you like terminal, you can use this to simply **generate the command and copy it** with a few clicks
- **Automatic dark mode** supported for macOS, Windows 10, and some Linux distros
- New FutureRestore features (with a supported FutureRestore build)
  - **Pwndfu** restore and **onboard** blobs
  - Set generator from blob

## Usage

See [how to use FutureRestore](https://ios.cfw.guide/futurerestore).

1. Download FutureRestore automatically through the **Download FutureRestore** button, or manually from [Cryptic & m1sta's fork](https://github.com/futurerestore/futurerestore/releases).
2. Select your **blob** (SHSH2) file.
3. Select your **target firmware** (iPSW) file.
4. Choose your desired arguments. See [this table](https://github.com/futurerestore/futurerestore#help) for an explanation of arguments.
5. Baseband and SEP (choose 1 each):
    1. If the latest Baseband and/or SEP firmware is compatible with your target version, select **Latest Baseband**/**Latest SEP**.
    2. Otherwise, choose **Manual Baseband**/**Manual SEP**, and select your desired **Baseband** and **SEP** (BBFW and IM4P), along with a BuildManifest (.PList).
    3. If your device is Wi-Fi only (no cellular/calling ability), select **No Baseband**. If it does not have a Secure Enclave, select **No SEP**.
6. **Start FutureRestore**!

- You can take your device out of recovery mode with **Exit Recovery**, which will set `auto-boot` to true and reboot the phone.
- You may kill the FutureRestore process while it is running, but it is considered unsafe. It is strongly recommended to not press the **Stop FutureRestore** button while the button's text indicates that it is "unsafe," unless you know what you are doing.
